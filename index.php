          <p>
            On my second year high school I don’t have any friends In my section because I’m new on their section and my classmate know all their classmate except me. After 1 month I have 2 friends which is my seatmate, their so funny and they also like basketball and billiard I always with them in lunch time. So we have a teacher and asking us if we see the imaginary line in the projector, no one is raising their hands so she pick on her attendance and that’s me and she ask me if I see the imaginary line but I don’t know what it is so I said yes and my classmate are laughing so loud and my teacher also. And she ask me again “if you see the imaginary line where in this classroom?” and I point out the metal near in our entrance door and there are laughing again and my teacher told me that I don’t allowed to seat because of my answer. In the next day my all classmate called me imaginary line just to tease me and they become my friend.

I spend my summer in our house because I don’t have money to have a great summer and yeah it's sad. When I’m in our house I always do the house hold chores and when I’m finish all the chores I will rest and I will be watching movies or episode in Netflix and sometimes I’m playing mobile games.

My expectation to this subject is that it will be enjoyable and i want to learned a lot about user design like new things. and i hope that i will pass this subject

                      <h4>A3: How would you design an interface for a 1000 floor elevator?</h4>
                      <p>If I would design an interface for a 1000 floor elevator, I will make 100 Elevator with the maximum capacity of 150 because the floor is 1000 so I need to have many elevator so that no one will wait longer. The user will tap which floor they will go and if they tap it wrong they just need to tap 4 0’s to repeat their wanted floor. I want also put a CCTV camera for safety because I want all the users to be safe and monitored. It also have a emergency call for their safety. You will see what floor you are now in the screen with arrow down or up so that you will not go to the wrong floor. </p>
					  <p>In this design, I think I will help the user to have a comfortable elevator and no one will wait longer because I will make 100 elevator that have a 150 maximum capacity. </p>
					  <p>the interface of this elevator its have a good color which blue and gray. you will see the floor in the left and the arrow is to know what floor are you now. you will top what floor will you go and click enter if you get wrong just click many zeros to reset. it also have a emergency call just incase somethings wrong. </p>

                      <p>GROUP 4: Needfinding</p>
<p>Members: Manzo, Zuniga, Cruz, Tolentino</p>
<p>Problem: Smartphones tend to be distractive while learning because of the connectivity it offers. The presence of smartphones affect the focus a student as one tries to check notifications to stay connected from time to time.</p>
					  <p>Supporting study: Researchers found that students sending and receiving messages while studying scored lower test results and were less effective at tasks such as note taking. It found that when students did not use mobiles, they were better at being able to recall information. (BBC)</p>
					  <p>We could easily place our phones to somewhere out of reach while studying to avoid this kind of distraction. But in this time of digitalization, learning materials are now becoming electronic and most of it can be easily accessed through our mobile phones. This now beats the purpose of placing your phone somewhere else because you now need it for studying. In addition, emergencies are mostly addressed through our phones which is why need it around almost all the time.</p>
					  <p>Supporting study: Cell phones give students access to tools and apps that can help them complete and stay on top of their class work. These tools can also teach students to develop better study habits, like time management and organization skills. (Oxford Learning)
App Solution:	Our group came up with an app idea solution for this problem which is, Study Lock. We find it very helpful to have this kind of app because all of us review our lecture notes in our mobile phones because it’s easier and paperless.

                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-5">
				  <p>Our app’s main feature is the complete lock, which will lock the phone from all of its features excluding emergency call features and partial lock, for selected apps only, for span of time set by the user. Both will be very effective as most people tend to still check their phones even without notification or any alerts receive. This will allow users to have undivided focus during study sessions. “Our phones are not just static, there are smart people behind it trying to get our attention. Everyone is fighting for our attention to turn it into profit.” (Nikola, D. 2017)</p>

We have a lot of confidence to go in front and have a presentation or answer of what is asking. Enjoyable and difficult because I see what we are doing next like creating a design with code so I find it difficult but I try my best to create a best idea. I learn something in this week the design process to help and guide us have a good and better design. This design process will guide us in the next month or in our project by following the steps. But earlier Ms. Arroyo said that we will not having a quiz because we are more on lesson that will help us to have more skills and improve the way we think. ">

Without having need finding your work could be spend months  for designing because you will misses the point of your work.  In the past years the touch of smartphone technology was hard and so slow sometimes it will not respond when you touched it. Having need finding the design or the future smartphone will be improve more and more to be the fast and comfortable to use. One of the example of need finding that shown in the class is shopping cart that will have a smart gadget I think the purpose of this work is to locate all your need and check your total item that you have. This will help customer to have a better shopping cart. They have this because they interviewed many users of what are the problem, issues and needs to improve the shopping or groceries. Having a error or fail in the start is okay that will be your guide and that id highlight of your work.">

It like I go back in my grade 9 activity because we do that way back in high school. But some of the basic html I forgot so I research and I ask my classmate to help so that I will have a simple html. 
	using Github and Heroku is kind of hard but fun In creating a web application, it was about us like introducing our self. With a background and color that will have a good web application. In using Github by submitting was not easy because its tricky and some of the System Unit in the comp lab have an account that cant remove. But submitting in Heroku was easy.
	I enjoy doing this HTML it was fun, I will never be bored doing this.">

This was a tricky game that I enjoyed, it will high your thinking and logic that’s why I enjoy but it was annoying because It boost my brain to think on what I’m gonna do next or what will I do to this next. In example in the first step we need to click yes but it doesn’t their it just NO button is their. So we search for it and click every so that we go to the next step. In first  I take it 10 minutes to finish but we given a chance to repeat again so the 2nd attempt I did it just a 2 minutes. 
                  I recommend this to be more fun in class and boost their logic and thinking because it will help them/us to improve their thinking and logic.">

help us to learn more about our course and we having fun on the activities in each organization we
participate on the mobile legends tournament by gaming genesis and I think that role I’ve take part was
lead to the success of the event I Also participate in every seminar in the Auditorium. The one that I
very like in the seminar last week was the Microsoft Hololens, it was amazing and so educational using
Hololens.
The event that I like the most is the event of JPCS as they were creating a UI design and who
have a good design that will be a winner. Second of the most I like is the Tournament of Mobile Legends
by gaming genesis I enjoy playing with my friends and other teams. Additional all of the events are very
good and awesome. Some events is creating a robot that will be more entertain. ---(Credit to APC-microsoft for the picture)">

application and also having a unique designs. Also Ms. Arroyo was a friendly Professional teacher that I
like also in the USERDES class. She is approachable when we need help and check to our works.
The challenges that I encountered is our project because first of all I thought that our project
will be change because it’s not be help the users but we do our best to approve. Also the web app its
challenging because some of the html code or functions that learned in I learned in high school was I
can’t remember. What I did is I use a template and learn what they use and find things and search
because I’m not familiar. Doing the web app it was enjoyable and entertaining because that was my first
time do the web app of mine. Doing this challenges is hard but I enjoy it and I find new things that I
didn’t know my knowledge is increasing and its very entertaining doing a web app.
My expectation on this finals is that maybe it will be more challenging and hard because its
finals there is no easy when its finals.">
